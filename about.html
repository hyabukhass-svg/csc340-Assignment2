    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <img src="images/princesses.jpg" alt="Princesses" class="character-image">
    <p>This website was created as a Disney princess character gallery. I wanted to practice designing a colorful, magical, and visually appealing website while learning HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>The color scheme (soft purple background, deep rose header, and cream navigation) is meant to create a warm, magical princess aesthetic. Fonts, card design, and consistent navigation ensure the site feels cohesive.</p>
    <p>Each character has a gallery card on the home page and a detailed profile page with story, abilities, and personality traits.</p>
